  <h1>Building Docker Images Dynamically with Go</h1>
  <time datetime=2019-08-22T00:00:00Z class="post-date">Thu, Aug 22, 2019</time>
  <p>I recently started looking into ways of automating microservices app deployment and one of the many things i needed to automate is the famous docker build command. I understand that i could take advantage of the installed Docker client on the host computer by using os/exec package, but my idea isn’t that simple and its not really fun compared to using github.com/docker/docker/client — refer to as goDockerClient henceforth. This post contains the steps i followed to building docker images successfully with goDockerClient</p>
<h3 id="understand-the-docker-buildcontext">Understand the Docker BuildContext</h3>
<p>After i spent some time checking out goDockerClient <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/docker/docker/client">GoDoc</a>, i felt like i was ready to start building docker images dynamically but i was wrong. It wasn’t as trivial as the Doc made it look, i thought all i had to do was call client.ImageBuild(context.Context, buildContext, opts) specifying my Dockerfile in opts.Dockerfile , after few unsuccessful trials, i began digging deeper. Turns out buildContext which is of type io.Reader is suppose to be the content of the image i am trying to build. Initially, i was doing something like this</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using just the Dockerfile as buildContext will not work because the docker daemon expect the buildContext to be all the files you’ll need in your new docker image.</p>
<h3 id="what-worked">What worked</h3>
<p>After understanding what docker meant by buildContext the task at hand became easier. We just need a way to wrap all the files in a dir — BuildContext into an io.Reader so that we can easily send this to docker deamon and have our image built. Luckily, there is a helper function in goDockerClient that does just this, just give it a directory and this function would tar it and give you an io.Reader .</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The final solution. The code below results to a successful dynamic docker build</p>
